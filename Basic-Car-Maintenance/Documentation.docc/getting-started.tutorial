            @Step {
                In the same folder that contains the Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template, run this command, in Terminal, to create a new Xcode configuration file (which properly sets up the signing information)
                
                `cp Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig`

            @Step {
                In the Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig file, fill in your DEVELOPMENT_TEAM and PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER. You can find this by logging into the Apple Developer Portal
                
                Note: A free account does not have a `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. Instead fill in `ABC123`. Do NOT run this app on a real device due to issues with the Sign in With Apple capability.

            Follow these steps to set up the Firebase Local Emulator to load data locally and not affect production. Please do not skip this step.
        }

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, if you haven't already:

                `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
            }
            @Step {
                Install Xcode command line tools:

                `xcode-select --install`
            }
            @Step {
                Install Node Version Manager (NVM). You then don't need to update the system node version.

                `brew install nvm`
            }
            @Step {
                Add the executable to the `$PATH` via `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file as prompted after installation. Do NOT forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)
            }
            @Step {
                Download and use the latest stable version of Node.js:

                `nvm install stable` 
            }
            @Step {
                `nvm use stable`
            }
            @Step {
                Install OpenJDK, and add the executable to the `$PATH` via `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file as prompted after installation. Do NOT forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)

                `brew install openjdk` 
            }
            @Step {
                Install Firebase Tools for running the emulator.

                `npm install -g firebase-tools`
            }
        }
    }

    @Section(title: "Start Working on an Issue") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            **BEFORE** starting on an issue, comment on the issue you want to work on.

            This prevents two people from working on the same issue. [Mikaela](https://github.com/mikaelacaron) (the maintainer) will assign you that issue, and you can get started on it.

            @Image(source: 7-issue.png, alt: "GitHub issue")
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue. 
                
                The `feature-name` part of the branch can be shortened or omitted and you add your username instead. No commits should be made to the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch shall only consist of the deployed code. Developers are expected to work on feature branches, and upon successful development and testing, a PR (pull request) must be opened to merge with `dev`. `git checkout -b issueNumber-feature-name`
                
                @Image(source: 8-checkout.png, alt: "Checkout issue locally")
            }
            @Step {
                Anytime you run the project, first in Terminal `cd` to `backend` in the Basic-Car-Maintenance directory. This is the directory with the `firebase.json` file, you should see that if you type `ls`

                `cd backend`
            }
            @Step {
                Start the Firebase Emulator. Which will start the emulators, and keep your data in local-data directory. Meaning when you start and stop the emulator your data will persist.

                `firebase emulators:start --import=./local-data --export-on-exit`
            }
            @Step {
                Run the app. You should see your anonymous user in Authentication, and once you add new data, see it in Firestore emulator UI at: http://127.0.0.1:4000/firestore
                
                If you don't see your user, delete the app from the simulator, and in the menu go to Device > Erase All Content and Settings (which resets your simulator), and try to run again
            }
            
            @Step {
                If you receive the following error when you launch the emulator:  _'firebase-tools no longer supports Java version before 11. Please upgrade to Java version 11 or above to continue using the emulators'_

                The openJDK install failed and you will have to install the latest JDK manually. You can download the latest version here [JDK23](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-mac) 
            }
            
            @Step {
                When your feature or fix is complete, open a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `dev` branch. Make sure to use a descriptive PR title and fill out the entire PR template without deleting any sections.
            }
        }
    }
