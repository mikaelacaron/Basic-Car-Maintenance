            @Step {
                In the same folder that contains the Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template, run this command, in Terminal, to create a new Xcode configuration file (which properly sets up the signing information)
                
                `cp Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig`

            }
            
            @Step {
                In the Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig file, fill in your DEVELOPMENT_TEAM and PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER. You can find this by logging into the Apple Developer Portal
                
                Note: A free account does not have a `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. Instead fill in `ABC123`. Do NOT run this app on a real device due to issues with the Sign in With Apple capability.

            Follow these steps to set up the Firebase Local Emulator to load data locally and not affect production. Please do not skip this step.
        }

        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Install Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, if you haven't already:

                `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
            }
            @Step {
                Install Xcode command line tools:

                `xcode-select --install`
            }
            @Step {
                Install Node Version Manager (NVM):

                `brew install nvm`

                Installs node version manager, so you don't need to update the system node version.
            }
            @Step {
                Add the executable to the `$PATH` via `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file as prompted after installation. Do NOT forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)
            }
            @Step {
                Download and use the latest stable version of Node.js:

                `nvm install stable`

                `nvm use stable`
            }
            @Step {
                Install OpenJDK:

                `brew install openjdk`

                Add the executable to the `$PATH` via `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file as prompted after installation. Do NOT forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)
            }
            @Step {
                Install Firebase Tools globally:

                `npm install -g firebase-tools`
            }
        }
    }

    @Section(title: "Start Working on an Issue") {
        @ContentAndMedia {
            **BEFORE** starting on an issue, comment on the issue you want to work on.

            This prevents two people from working on the same issue. [Mikaela](https://github.com/mikaelacaron) (the maintainer) will assign you that issue, and you can get started on it.

            @Image(source: 7-issue.png, alt: "GitHub issue")
        }
        
        @Steps {
            @Step {
                Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue. 
                
                The `feature-name` part of the branch can be shortened or omitted and you add your username instead. No commits should be made to the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch shall only consist of the deployed code. Developers are expected to work on feature branches, and upon successful development and testing, a PR (pull request) must be opened to merge with `dev`. `git checkout -b issueNumber-feature-name`
                
                @Image(source: 8-checkout.png, alt: "Checkout issue locally")
            }
            @Step {
                Anytime you run the project, first navigate in Terminal to the `backend` directory (the directory with the `firebase.json` file) before starting the Firebase Emulator.

                `cd backend`
            }
            @Step {
                Start the Firebase Emulator:

                `firebase emulators:start --import=./local-data --export-on-exit`
            }
            @Step {
                When your feature or fix is complete, open a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `dev` branch. Make sure to use a descriptive PR title and fill out the entire PR template without deleting any sections.
            }
        }
    }
}
