# Basic Car Maintenance
Welcome to my open source app! At this moment it's a work in progress, but it will be ready for contributors for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/)! Use this app to gain experience getting started in open source for iOS and macOS development using Swift!

# Getting Started
* Read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
* Read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines
* Download Xcode 15 or later, and macOS 14.0 or later
* Browse the open [issues](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance/issues) and **comment** which you would like to work on
   * It is only one person per issue, except where noted.
* Fork this repo
* Clone the repo to your machine
* In the same folder that contains the `Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template`, run this command, in Terminal, to create a new Xcode configuration file (which properly sets up the signing information)

```sh
cp Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig
```

* In the Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig file, fill in your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`.
   * Example: `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = IdNumber`
   * You can find this by logging into the Apple Developer Portal
   * This is only needed when running on a real device for iOS, this works with both free or paid Apple Developer accounts.
* Build the project :white-check-mark:

* Checkout a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue
