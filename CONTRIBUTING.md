# Contribution Guidelines
This document contains the rules and guidelines that developers are expected to follow, while contributing to this repository.

* All contributions must NOT add any SwiftLint warnings or errors. There is a GitHub action setup for any PRs to `dev`, and Xcode will show any warnings/errors.

# About the Project
This app was created for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), to help beginners in iOS dev contribute to open source. It is an app to help keep track of your car maintenance activites. This project uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore), and Sign in With Apple.

### Project Status
This app will be deployed on the Apple App Store, available for iOS 17.0 or later, [Mikaela Caron](https://github.com/mikaelacaron) (the maintainer) will upload it to the App Store after Hacktoberfest.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
* Download Xcode 16.0 or later
* Install [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) onto your machine via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   * This is not a requirement, but is preferred.
```sh
brew install swiftlint
```

* Set your Xcode settings correctly:
   * Open Xcode Settings `Cmd + ,`
   * Text Editing
   * Indentation tab
   * Prefer Indent using Spaces
   * Tab Width: 4
   * Indent Width: 4
   * Xcode 16+
    * Check "Prefer Settings from EditorConfig"

## Start Here
* **Fork** this repo
* **Clone** the repo to your machine (do **not** open Xcode yet)
* In the same folder that contains the `Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template`, run this command, in Terminal, to create a new Xcode configuration file (which properly sets up the signing information)

```sh
cp Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig.template Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig
```

* Open Xcode

* In the `Basic-Car-Maintenance.xcconfig` file, fill in your `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` and `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`.
   * You can find this by logging into the Apple Developer Portal
   * This works with both free or paid Apple Developer accounts. Do **NOT** run this app on a real device due to issues with the Sign in With Apple capability.

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABC123
PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.mycompany.Basic-Car-Maintenance
```

* Build the project ✅

## Setup the Firebase Emulator
We are going to set up the Firebase emulator to be able to load the data locally and not affect production. Please do not skip this step.
* Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
   * Package manager for macOS, to install more things
* Install Xcode command line tools with `xcode-select --install`
* `brew install nvm`
   * Installs node version manager, so you don't need to update the system node version
   * Add the executable to the $PATH via .zshrc or .bashrc file as prompted after installation, do **NOT** forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)
* `nvm install stable`
* `nvm use stable`
   * to download and use the latest stable version of node
* `brew install openjdk`
   * Add the executable to the $PATH via .zshrc or .bashrc file as prompted after installation, do **NOT** forget this! (and then restart your Terminal)
* `npm install -g firebase-tools`
   * Installs the Firebase tools for running the emulator

## Start Working on an Issue
* Anytime you run the project, first in Terminal `cd` to `backend` in the `Basic-Car-Maintenance` directory
   * this is the directory with the `firebase.json` file, you should see that if you type `ls`
* Run `firebase emulators:start --import=./local-data --export-on-exit`, which will start the emulators, and keep your data in `local-data` directory.
   * Meaning when you start and stop the emulator your data will persist.
* Run the app
   * You should see your anonymous user in Authentication, and once you add new data, see it in Firestore emulator UI at: http://127.0.0.1:4000/firestore
   * If you don't see your user, delete the app from the simulator, and in the menu go to Device > Erase All Content and Settings (which resets your simulator), and try to run again
   * If you receive the following error when you launch the emulator: _'firebase-tools no longer supports Java version before 11. Please upgrade to Java version 11 or above to continue using the emulators.'_ The openJDK install failed and you will have to install the latest JDK manually. You can download the latest version here [JDK23](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-mac)
* **Checkout** a new branch (from the `dev` branch) to work on an issue
* When your feature / fix is complete open a pull request, PR, from your feature branch to the `dev` branch
   * Use a descriptive PR title and fill out the entire PR template, do not delete any sections.

# Branches and PRs
* No commits should be made to the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch shall only consist of the deployed code
* Developers are expected to work on feature branches, and upon successful development and testing, a PR (pull request) must be opened to merge with `dev`
* Use kebab-case for branch names
✅ **Examples of valid branch names:**
   * 8123-fix-title-of-issue (issue number)
   * 8123-feature-name (issue number)

❌ **Examples of invalid branch names**:
   * username-testing
   * attemptToFixAuth
   * SomethingRandom
