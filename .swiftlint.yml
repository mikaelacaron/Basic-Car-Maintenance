# By default, SwiftLint uses a set of sensible default rules you can adjust:
disabled_rules: # rule identifiers turned on by default to exclude from running
  - trailing_whitespace
  - empty_parentheses_with_trailing_closure
opt_in_rules: # some rules are turned off by default, so you need to opt-in
  - empty_count
  - closure_parameter_position
  - closing_brace
  - comma
  - colon
  - cyclomatic_complexity
  - duplicate_imports
  - for_where
  - force_try

# Alternatively, specify all rules explicitly by uncommenting this option:
# only_rules: # delete `disabled_rules` & `opt_in_rules` if using this
#   - empty_parameters
#   - vertical_whitespace

included: # paths to include during linting. `--path` is ignored if present.
excluded: # paths to ignore during linting. Takes precedence over `included`.

# they can set both implicitly with an array

  - 400 # error
# or they can set both explicitly

# naming rules can set warnings/errors for min_length and max_length
# additionally they can set excluded names
